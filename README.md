# godot-valet
Project is now using Godot 4.2

A tool for godot developers that automated packaging and deploying to itch.io. It can package windows, linux and web exports with a single click. That includes versioning, naming and zipping of packages. With one more click, all your chosen packages can be published to itch.io using butler. Obviously requires some setup but once that's done, publishing from that point forward is a snap or specically... two clicks. The tool is also useful for managing projects and godot versions.

Known Issues:
- Godot 4 Warning: ... registry lookup failed to get layer manifest files ... (vulkan display driver issue). Just waiting for godot or nvidia folks to fix this. Just a warning.
